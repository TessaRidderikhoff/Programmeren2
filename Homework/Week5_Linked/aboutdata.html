    <ul><h4>About the data</h4></ul>

    <ul>Gender equality is an important issue for human development, ranging widely across the globe. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is an indicator of equality in health, empowerment and the labour market. Health is measured by maternal mortality rate and adolescent birth rate, empowerment is measured by the percentage of seats in the parliament held by females and the proportion of females with at least some secondary education, and labour market is measured by the labour force participation rate of women. A more equal society between men and women results in a lower GII.
	In this map, the GII is depicted by colour in 159 countries. This way, it becomes clear that there is a large difference between countries in female equality. To learn more about the situation in this country concerning gender equality, a bar graph is depicted for each country (with available data) about the average number of years women and men have received education. Since education is a factor in the GII, it is expected that countries with higher GIIâ€™s have a lower average number of years of education for women than for men. Upon inspection of the data, this turns out to often not be true. On average, women actually receive education for a longer period than men. Still, a difference between countries on amount of education is notable: countries with a lower GII often have a higher number of average years of education for women. 
	Also important is the development of equality in the world. That is why the average number of years of education is depicted for years 1990-2015, giving an idea of the progress of equality in the country. In a lot of countries, an increase of average years of education can be seen, especially in countries with high GII scores. This is positive news, indicating at least development of gender equality in the world. The GII across the years can be viewed as well, by pressing the years on the x-axis of the bar graph. The GII is not available for every country for each year, but still can give an idea of the general development of gender equality. On average, the GII seems to decrease over the years, which is positive news as well.
	Overall, this dataset depicts part of the problem of gender inequality, focussing on female education, clarifying differences across the globe. </ul>
